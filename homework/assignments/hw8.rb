# Homework Assignment #8
# Using hashes and reviewing what came before
# 
# For this homework assignment we'll use the CSV file: makler_november.csv 
# which lists details about property for sale and rent in november from Makler.
# This file can be found in the directory datafiles in your repository

# - if you need help with hashes, try here: http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.3/Hash.html
# - if you need help with loading the csv, try here: http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.1.3/libdoc/csv/rdoc/CSV.html

#### IMPORTANT: after each step, use a puts statement to write out the variable(s) that you just created, like:
#### puts "new_poem = #{new_poem}"
#### 
#### It will also be good to use a puts statement as a separator between each step, like:
#### puts "------------------"
#### puts "----- Step 3 -----"
#### puts "------------------"
####
#### These are not required, but it does help make it easier to look at your output and know what your are looking at.

###
# 1. Load the Makler CSV file and assign it to the variable data. Be sure to indicate that your
# data has a header when you load it.

###
# 2. Create a new variable called heating and assign to it all the posts that have central heating
# and is an apartment.

###
# 3. If the posts in the heating variable has three or more rooms, assign the posts from question
# to the variable big. If the posts has fewer than three rooms, assign them to the variable small.

###
# 4. For each variable big and small, what are the 5 most frequently used words used in the
# column additional_info? Remember, you must clean the string first, then normalize it, before
# you count. Refer to the notes from class if you can't remember how to do this.
