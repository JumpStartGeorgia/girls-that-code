# Homework Assignment #1

This assignment should cover everything we did this week. If you get stuck, don't worry. Try to work through it step-by-step. The next step is to post a question in the girls-that-code repo issues:

[https://github.com/JumpStartGeorgia/girls-that-code/issues](https://github.com/JumpStartGeorgia/girls-that-code/issues)

1. Open a terminal.
2. Change your directory to your OWN homework directory for your OWN submissions:

`/girls-that-code/homework/submissions/your_name/`

3. Create a new directory on your Desktop called `hw1`.
4. Change your directory to the newly created `hw1`.
5. Open your text editor. Create a new file and save it in the newly created directory, `hw1`. Call it `firstname_lastname.rb` (where you use your first and last name in the filename).
6. Write some lines of code that assigns the following text to variable named `poem`:

```
  Jack and Jill went up the hill
  To fetch a pail of water.
  Jack fell down and broke his crown,
  And Jill came tumbling after.
```

7. First, use a method on poem to separate each line of text into an array of lines. You did this in Try Ruby.
8. Add another method to take that array of lines and reverse them.
9. Add another method to join all those lines back together after you've reversed them.
10. Save the new, line-reversed poem to a new variable named `new_poem`.
11. Print the value of the variable new_poem to the screen using puts.
12.   When you execute the file, you should see this:

```
  And Jill came tumbling after.
  Jack fell down and broke his crown,
  To fetch a pail of water.
  Jack and Jill went up the hill
```
