# Homework Assignment #1

###
# This assignment should cover everything we did this week.
#
# 1. Open a terminal.
# 2. Change your directory to your OWN homework directory for your OWN 
#    submissions:
#
# /girls-that-code/homework/submissions/your_name/
#
# 3. Create a new directory on your Desktop called 'hw1'.
# 4. Change your directory to the newly created 'hw1'.
# 5. Open your text editor. Create a new file and save it in the newly created
#    directory, 'hw1'. Call it 'firstname_lastname.rb' (where you use your
#    first and last name in the filename).
# 6. Create a variable called 'poem' and set it equal to the following text:
#
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      #  Jack and Jill went up the hill
#  To fetch a pail of water.
#  Jack fell down and broke his crown,
#  And Jill came tumbling after.
#
# 7. Create a variable called 'new_poem' and set it equal to the string that is
#    created by performing the following methods on the previous variable
#    in one line from left to right
# 7.1. First, use a method on the variable 'poem' to separate each line of text 
#      into an list of lines. You did this in Try Ruby.
# 7.2. Add another method by chaining to take that array of lines and reverse 
#      them.
# 7.3. Add another method by chaining to join all those lines back together  
#      after you've reversed them.
# 8. Print the value of the variable 'new_poem' to the screen using puts.
# 9. When you execute the file, you should see this string:
#
#  And Jill came tumbling after.
#  Jack fell down and broke his crown,
#  To fetch a pail of water.
#  Jack and Jill went up the hill
#
# If you get stuck, don't worry. Try to work through it step-by-step. 
# If you still can't figure out the solution, post a question in the 
# girls-that-code repo issues:
#
# https://github.com/JumpStartGeorgiap
/girls-that-code/issues
#
# When you are done, add your file to your the git repository.
# Then commit your changes with a relevant message.
# Pull any new changes from the git repo first.
# Then push your changes to the repo.
