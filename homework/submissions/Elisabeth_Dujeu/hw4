## Feedback from Jason
# - all homework files should have a file extension of .rb
# - did you try runing the file by using: ruby hw4?  You should always run the file to make sure it works.
#
# #1 - you need the require statement at the top of the file in order for the CSV to load the data
#    - in line 2, you have #{{rows.length}} - there should only be one set of {} - #{rows.length}
#    - in line 3, you have [[row1 content]], [[row2 content]], etc.] - there should only be one set of [] - [ [row1 content], [row2 content], etc.]
# #3 - you onle need rows.select once and all of the tests are inside of it: rows.select{|row| row[1] == 'for rent' && row[2] == 'apartment' && ...}
# #4 - you are trying to use tbilisi_4_rm_house_for_sale.select and this will fail because tbilisi_4_rm_house_for_sale does not exist yet. Instead, you should use apts_for_rent.select
# #5 - same problem as #4 - you should use rows.select and like #3, you only need one select statement
#    - also, you should set office_sale_100sqm = rows.select, not office_sale_100sqm = "rows.select"
