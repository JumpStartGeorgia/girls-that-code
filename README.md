In school exit exams, girls in Georgia do slightly better than their male counterparts across the board in:
* Math
* Biology
* Chemistry
* Physics
* Geography

While at the same time, girls lack the confidence and support needed to do well in these fields.
Did you know that:
* only 59.2 % of parents agree that women have the same level of capabilities in technical subjects as men
* 95.9 % of students consider their parents' role important in the study process

That is some messed up statistics.

It is time to turn the tables on those statistics. Girls That Code is a supportive environement to encourage and teach women to code. It is free, open to the public, and is made up solely of women. Girls That Code meets once a week and slowly and methodically works with you to ensure that you understand the concepts and how to apply them to your needs so you can get the most out of your new skilz!

Our second session's orientation is on 22 September at 19:00 at [JumpStart's office](http://maps.ge/s/SkUe). Come join us!

All participants who attend most classes and complete the majority of homework assignments will:
* receive their very own fancy certificate
* will be eligible for a letter of recommendation
* will leave with the satisfaction that they have a new tool to use in problem solving
* of course, the possibility of free t-shirts, stickers and more as well
